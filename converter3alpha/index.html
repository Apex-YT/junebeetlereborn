			<h1>Scratch 3 Converter (Alpha)</h1>
			<p>Hey everybody! I don't use Scratch anymore and wasn't really planning to make this. But after the success of <a href="/converter">my Scratch 2 converter</a> and a lot of emails and comments, I figured I'd give it a try after all. Enjoy!</p>
			<br>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Unlike the previous version, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch 3.0</a> is entirely web-based (made with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org">webpack</a>, and <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a>) so I had to completely rewrite this from the ground up. Rather than a SWF file, this program produces Electron-based native apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The converter itself is written in Java.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Download</h2>
			<p>Be warned, this is a <i>very early</i> version. As in, hacked together in a day and basically untested. So, please <a href="/contact">tell me</a> if you encounter any bugs, and expect several updates before it works properly. <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">Java</a> is required for conversion (but not to run the converted applications).
