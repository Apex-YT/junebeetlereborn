			<h1>macOS Mojave Patches</h1>
			<p>This page lists my contributions to <a href="http://dosdude1.com">dosdude1</a>'s <a href="http://dosdude1.com/mojave/">Mojave patching project</a>. They're already credited on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473">this thread</a>, though, so this page exists solely for <s>my ego</s> convenience.</p>

			<p>I'm happy to say that I accomplished the following:
			<br>• Discovered how to <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-68#post-26222082">boot Mojave on a Penryn-based system</a> (refined by <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/members/jackluke.1133911/">@jackluke</a> as described <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-71#post-26222642">here</a>, analysis of another "solution" <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-433#post-26877298">here</a> just for fun)
			<br>• Enabled graphics acceleration on nVidia Tesla systems with a <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-85#post-26230707">dumb hack</a>, and later a <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-102#post-26239785">less dumb one</a>

			<br>• <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-370#post-26689955">Fixed communication with Arduinos</a> on old USB hardware
			<br>• Found how to <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-10-14-mojave-on-unsupported-macs-thread.2121473/page-573#post-27284257">re-enable</a> acceleration on macOS 10.14.5 betas
			<br>
			<br>These fixes have been incorporated into the <a href="http://dosdude1.com/mojave/">patcher</a>. It's been an honor to help such a legendary developer, even just a bit. I learned a lot! And I'm ecstatic that my old MacBook now has dark theme.</p>

			<h2>Manual Patching</h2>
			<p>I prefer to patch my system manually rather than using a magic tool. For any others who feel the same or want to understand the process, a text file summarizing my steps (current as of macOS 10.14.5 DP2) is attached here. Be warned -- this is time consuming and requires some experience.</p>
